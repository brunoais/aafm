# Android ADB File Manager #

A command line + GUI (GTK based) Android ADB-based file manager

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zymos/aafm/master/screenshot.png)

Android uses of MTP (Massive Transfer Protocol) for file transfers. Unfortunately this is still very buggy and doesn't work well: system slowing down to a halt when transferring large number of files, files which are there but cannot be seen by the computer... etc.

So **aafm** uses Android Debug protocal.  Using ADB (one of the command line tools provided with the official Android SDK) for communicating with the Android device.  Making it a simple file manager to transfer files.

## Hacking ##

I'm by no means a GTK/Python/ADB/Android expert. I'm just learning so this project will surely contain many things that can be improved or that are plain wrong, so feel free to clone the repository and submit pull requests :-)

In order to make your life a bit easier I'll roughly show what each file does:

* **aafm** - shell script to execute aafm-gui.py
* **Aafm.py** - a class that communicates with an Android device, using ADB via shell commands. Takes care of copying and reading files, listing and parsing directories, etc.
* **aafm-gui.py** - this is the GTK front-end. Takes care of building the window with the host and device panels, and issuing instructions to Aafm when the user requests something to be done.
* **TreeViewFile.py** - a utility class that encapsulates a GTKTreeView and some more things in order to show file listings.
* **MultiDragTreeView.py** - an awesome class developed by the guys of Quod Libet, that allows more than one element of a TreeView to be selected and dragged around.

As you can see, an **aafm-cli.py** GUI counterpart is missing. There was one at the beginning but I didn't redo it when I rewrote most of the code from scratch. Feel free to... you know what, if you're interested in having a CLI version.


## Tested On ##
This was initially developed in an Ubuntu Linux 10.10 system. I thought it wouldn't work on other systems, but it seems people are using it in a lot of places though. Some environments where it's known to work:

- Debian 7.0, 8.9
- Ubuntu 10.10, 11.04, 11.10
- Arch Linux
- Windows (!!!)


## TO DO ##

I'm now using Github's issue tracker to keep track of issues, bugs and wished-for features.

If you'd like to have a certain feature or think you've found a bug that is not in the list, please add it to the issue tracker at https://github.com/sole/aafm/issues
